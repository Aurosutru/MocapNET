# MocapNET
We present MocapNET, an ensemble of SNN encoders that estimates the 3D human body pose based on 2D joint estimations extracted from monocular RGB images. MocapNET provides an efficient divide and conquer strategy for supervised learning. It outputs skeletal information directly into the BVH format which can be rendered in real-time or imported without any additional processing in most popular 3D anima- tion software.   The proposed architecture achieves very fast (300Hz) 3D human pose estimations using only CPU processing.
