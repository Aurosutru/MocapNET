This is a web interface for MocapNET based on AmmarServer.

You can have a PC that acts like a pose server and then connect clients to it to save resources.

If you want to use it you need to select AmmarServer from the initialize.sh script 
if you are switching between builds you might also want to remove your build directory and make a new one so that the CMake flags will get properly updated..
